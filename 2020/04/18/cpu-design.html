<p>Hello everyone and welcome to my newest series: a blog about how to build a custom CPU – circuit by circuit!  The goal of this series is to show you how an actual CPU is designed and implemented at the circuit level.  Then later we can explore how the design is then brought over to the transistor level.</p>

<p>Maybe you are asking yourself, why on earth would you want to do such a thing?  Doesn’t it just work?  Why would I need to understand this? The answer is simple.  I’ve spent many years writing emulators for different consoles, and to achieve this feat I have to learn about how the entire system functions as a whole.  If you were ever curious of how I accomplish these projects now is your chance to see my thought process in how I see bit patterns in CPUs and then translate them to working emulator code for another platform.</p>

<h2 id="series-structure">Series Structure</h2>

<p>Before we begin into the harrowing adventure of circuits and CPUs, we must work out some possible gaps in knowledge and start with solidifying a strong understanding of computer number systems.  Since circuits can only work with on and off signals, binary(as most of use already know) is one of the key fundamentals prior to starting.  Then we must work on a solid foundation of boolean logic and how we use them to manipulate desired results in a circuit.  Then we will take a short detour into Lambda calculus to work in a bit of computational theory to ensure one understands what it means to be computable.</p>

<p>I hope you guys can join me in my next post: <em>Alien number systems</em></p>
